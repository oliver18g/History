  <h3>Jeff B<br>Beach; Scenic Reserve - all stunning.</h3>
  <p>On our way to Gisborne we went first to the Mahia Penisula Scenic Reserve and did a 4.5 km. track. Long distance views across mountains and water were interspersed with forest that felt like Jurassic Park. It was lovely. Finished the day with a visit to Mahia Beach for a quick swim. Great place to spend time.</p>
  <h3>KBNZ666<br>One of my favourite places</h3>
  <p>This was one of my favourite places to visit while growing up.
My family would go swimming and fishing here, for walks around the rock pools, shell collecting at Mahunga beach, and fish n chips at Mahia Beach. I love seeing the bach's with their characteristics.</p>
  <h3>Rus H<br>Great place to visit on a late Autumn sunny day</h3>
  <p>We visited on a gorgeous sunny late Autumn day and there was no one around except a few locals. No wind and sun and view were endless.</p>
  <h3>Wayne N<br>Wild open area</h3>
  <p>About 90km south of Gisborne the Mahia Peninsula is a 20km detour off the main road heading to Napier.
The colour of the ocean and stark beach fronts are spectacular.
At Mahia Beach there is camping and accommodation which appears popular.
Also public toilets. Pub and shops.
    We loved this detour and recommend it, if you are in no hurry.</p>
