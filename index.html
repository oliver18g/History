  <h1>Arrival of Takitimu</h1>
  <p>On its arrival in Aotearoa, in the fourteenth century, the sacred waka Takitimu made its way from its first landing spot at Awanui (near Ninety Mile Beach) down the east coast of the North Island. Eventually the waka arrived at the place called Te Papa near Kaiuku Marae. It was there that the high priest, Ruawharo, Left the waka and decided to settle overlooking Mahia Beach. Ruawharo proceeded to plant mauri (life principle) of the whales and fish of the sea which is said to have brought the whales to the bay. The meeting house at Opoutama is named Ruawharo as a monument to the renowned tipuna.<p>
  <h1>Kahungunu and Rongomaiwahine</h1>
  <p>It was stories of the beautiful Rongomaiwahine that lured Kahungunu to Mahia and when he finally reached here he was delighted to find that the stories were not exaggerated. Kahungunu and Rongomaiwahine were eventually married. This Marriage is described as unique not only because of the intrigue surrounding it, but because of how it changed the whole history of the East Coast. This union has brought about the current Nagti Kahungunu and Rongomaiwahine iwi of Mahia.<p>
  <h1>European Settlement </h1>
  <p>The First pakeha trader to inhabit the Mahia Peninsula lived in the area from 1829. In 1837 whalers arrived establishing two whaling stations by 1850. Mahia served as a principal whaling base in the north Island. Sheep farming began in the 1840's. From here the area developed into a series of pastoral farms.</p>
